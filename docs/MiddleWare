This is a piece of code or function that runs between the server getting a requests
and responding. There is a possiblity that a middle can be not run when we send a response
before reaching the middleware. They are usually with the code app.use()

middleware help us in responding to 404 error pages, logging server requests info
whenever we get a request. An example of this is morgan

npm install morgan

They also help us in serving static files like css, images etc, A example of this
is express' static middleware.
