Mongo DB Setup Options

- Install locally and use and then deploy that

- use a cloud db that is hosted for us  : mongodb atlas , its free : Build a cluster
  create a database and collection, 
  create a new database user with user and password
  give read and write access

username : admin
	password : admin

- To connect, click the connect - connect your application - get the connection string
  we will then have to a make a connection, we could do this by using the plain mongodb api
  package and make queries, or we could use the mongoose package 


  MONGOOSE 

  mongoose is an ODM (Object document mapping) library, this means it allows us to create model from
  our mongodb database and gives us function such as create delete get find etc

  We work with mongoose by creating schemas and models;

  example : user schema: - name (string), required
                         - age (number)
                         - bio (string)

 we will then create a model based on this schema and then the model will give us
 access to methods such as save, get delete etc


 install mongoose : npm install mongoose


Once our connection to our mongodb is done, we can create our models and schemas

we can create a folder and file and name it blog.js for our blog model, this is where
we create our schema and wrap the schema in a model

we can then import this file and use the model to create find or delete our collection documents
